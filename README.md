# GridBasedAuthentication

The most common method among all the methods used for authentication are textual passwords. But textual passwords are vulnerable to eves dropping, dictionary attacks and shoulder surfing. Graphical passwords are used as alternative techniques for textual passwords. Most of the graphical schemes are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. To solve this problem, texts are combined with colors to generate session passwords for authentication. Session passwords can be used only once, every time a new password is generated. In this program, we generate session passwords using texts and colors which are resistant to shoulder surfing. These methods are suitable for Personal Digital Assistants (PDAâ€™s)
